\begin{summary}
We present a method for inverting total-field anomaly data to estimate the geometry of 
a uniformly magnetized 3-D geological source in subsurface. The method assumes 
the total-magnetization direction is known. We approximate the source by an 
ensemble of vertically juxtaposed right prisms, all of them with the same 
total-magnetization vector and depth extent. The horizontal cross-section 
of each prism is defined by a polygon having the same number of vertices 
equally spaced from $0^{\circ}$ to $360^{\circ}$. The position of these 
vertices, the horizontal location of each prism and the depth extent of all prisms 
are the parameters to be estimated by solving a constrained nonlinear inverse problem 
of minimizing a goal function. 
We run successive inversions for a range of tentative total-magnetization intensities 
and depths to the top of the shallowest prism. The estimated models producing 
the lowest values of the goal function form the set of candidate solutions.
To obtain stable solutions, we impose the zeroth- and first-order Tikhonov 
regularizations on the shape of the prisms. The method allows estimating the geometry 
of both vertical and inclined sources by the suitable use of first-order Tikhonov 
regularization. Tests with synthetic data produced by simple and complex simulated 
bodies show the efficiency of our method in retrieving the shape of the magnetic 
source. Results obtained by inverting airborne total-field anomaly data over the 
Anit{\'a}polis alkaline-carbonatitic complex, in southern Brazil, 
suggest that the emplacement of the magnetic sources was controlled by NW-SE-trending 
faults at depth, in accordance with known structural features at the study area.
