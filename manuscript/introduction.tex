\section{Introduction}

The interpretation of total-field anomalies on the surface of the Earth is an 
important challenge in exploration geophysics due to the nonuniqueness of 3-D magnetic 
inversion. It is well-known that several magnetization distribution in subsurface 
can reproduce the same magnetic data with the same accuracy. 
To overcome this inherent ambiguity, a priori information need to be introduced 
for reducing the number of possible solutions coherent with the local geology.
There are basically two groups of 3-D magnetic inversion methods. The available 
a priori information determines the suitable approach for each case.

The first group is formed methods approximating the source by a geometrically 
simple causative body having its geometry defined by a small number of parameters 
\citep[e.g., ][]{ballantyne-1980,bhattacharyya-1980,silva-1983}. These methods 
estimate both the geometry and the physical property of the source by solving 
a nonlinear inverse problem. Due to the very restrictive parametrization, 
such methods usually do not have severe problems with ambiguity.

The second group is formed by the vast majority of methods. 
They approximate the subsurface by a grid of juxtaposed rectangular prisms having 
a constant total-magnetization direction. Some methods presume that a purely induced 
magnetization \citep[e.g., ][]{cribb-1976,li_3-d_1996,pilkington_3-d_1997} and the 
isotropic magnetic susceptibility of the prisms is the quantity estimated by solving 
a linear inverse problem. Different approaches have improved this inversion method. To obtain focused images of the subsurface, \cite{portniaguine_focusing_1999} and \cite{portniaguine_3d_2002} introduced the minimum gradient support to minimize the effect of strong variations and discontinuity on the parameters by inverting magnetic anomaly and any component of the total anomalous field. Other studies introduced strategies to constraint the nonuniqueness and delineate the source \cite[]{tontini,pilkington_3d_2009,shamsipour_3d_2011,cella_inversion_2012,abedi-2015}. Exceptionally, some of these methods allow a magnetization direction 
different from that of the local main field \cite[e.g., ][]{pignatelli-2006}. 
In this case, the parameters to be estimated are the total-magnetization intensities 
of the prisms. 
In all these methods, the geometry of the magnetic sources is estimated indirectly, 
by interpreting the estimated susceptibility or total-magnetization intensity 
distribution. 
Theoretically, these methods are capable of recovering the geometry of complex 
sources. However, they require a lot of a priori information to overcome 
their nonuniqueness and instability due to the large number of parameters 
to be estimated by inversion. Additionally, they are characterized by a high 
computational cost associated with the solution of large linear systems.

The third group of 3-D magnetic inversion methods presume some knowledge about the 
physical property distribution and estimate the geometry of the sources. 
They are usually formulated as nonlinear inverse problems. 
\citet{wang_inversion_1990} approximate the source by a polyhedron and estimate 
the position of its vertices in the Fourier domain. 
\citet{wenbin-2017} have developed a multiple level-set method to estimate geometry 
of a set of causative bodies with uniform magnetic susceptibility. 
These methods have a small number of parameters to be estimated by inversion and 
much less ambiguity problems if compared to those methods the second group. 

We present a magnetic inversion method to estimate the geometry of an isolated 
and uniformly 3-D magnetic source having known total-magnetization direction.
Our method is an extension for total-field anomaly data of those methods presented 
by \cite{oliveirajr-etal2011} and \cite{oliveirajr-barbosa2013} for inverting 
gravity and gravity-gradient data, respectively. 
We approximate the source by an interpretation model formed vertically juxtaposed 
right prisms having horizontal cross-sections defined by polygons, all
of them with the same number of vertices.
For convenience, all prisms have the same depth extension and total-magnetization 
intensity.
Differently from \cite{oliveirajr-etal2011} and \cite{oliveirajr-barbosa2013}, 
our method estimates not only the position of the vertices defining the horizontal 
cross-sections and the horizontal position, but also the depth extension of all 
prisms forming the interpretation model. Additionally, we run the inversion for 
different values of total-magnetization intensities and depths to the top 
of the shallowest prism. Among the estimated models, those producing the 
lowest values of goal function form the set of candidate models.
To obtain a stable solutions, use the same set of regularizing functions proposed by 
\cite{oliveirajr-etal2011} and also propose a new one for constraining the 
depth extent of the prisms. 

A test with synthetic data produced by a simple symmetric model shows the performance 
of our method in an ideal case. We also applied our method to interpret the synthetic 
data produced by a complex sources having variable shape and dip along depth. The 
results show that our method can be a very useful tool for interpreting magnetic data 
in real situations. Based on these results with synthetic data, we applied our method 
to interpret airborne data located over the alkaline-carbonatitic complex of 
Anit{\'a}polis, in the Santa Catarina state, Brazil. Our results bring some light 
on the debate about the structural control of the Anit{\'a}polis complex. 
Our results suggest that the complex follows a NW-SE direction at depth, in agreement 
with known geological structures not only located at, but also northward and southward 
the study area. These results attest that our method is a promising tool for interpreting 
total-field anomaly data.
